                <h4>What to bring:</h4>
                <p><strong>Stuff you should bring if you plan to play games:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                	<li>A surge protector - we only offer each player one plug.</li>
                    <li>6' or longer Ethernet cord (We also supply some)</li>
                    <li>Your Desktop or Laptop</li>
                    <li>Gaming Consoles</li>
                    <li>Headphones - do not bring speakers! Speakers are way more likely to disturb your neighbors.</li>
                    <li>Monitor - TV monitors are allowed, but only if space does not become an issue. If it is an issue, we may ask you to relocate or use a smaller monitor. (This has never happened, but be forewarned)</li>
                    <li>A chair - optional. We do have folding chairs for everyone to use, but if you prefer a rolling chair/more comfortable chair, feel free to bring one, as long as it does not take up too much space. (again, hasn't been an issue before)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Stuff everyone should bring:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Money for food, t-shirts, and drinks.</li>
                    <li>Student ID - if you are a current Penn College student, you MUST bring a current student ID. (This lets you partake in the student-only door prizes)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Stuff you can bring if you want to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                	<li>You may bring any controller you wish to use for free-play, but there are NO third-party or modded controllers allowed for tournaments. Tourney masters have ultimate decision.</li>
                    <li>If you have a specific console game you would like to play, please bring it!</li>
                    <li>You may also bring your own console. We will have a secure area for console storage, but ultimately you are responsible for your own console!</li>
                    <li>We also offer a small number of projectors available for personal consoles that wish to use them. (We would prefer that these be used for cooperative or multiplayer games)</li>
                </ul>
