                <h4>Computer and Console Responsibility</h4>
                
                <p>**Your stuff, your responsibility! The ACM and Gamer's Guild will not be taking responsibility for any attendee computers or consoles!**</p>
                <p>This event would not be possible if it weren’t for the people who bring their gaming rigs and game consoles.</p>
                <p>All PCs and accessories, such as monitors, mouse, and keyboard, will be set up in the PC area, and it will be solely the responsibility of the attendee.  To date, we have never had a single theft at a BYOC event.  However, we still ask that you be responsible and smart.  Lock your computer when you're not present and always keep an eye on it.</p>
                <p>The consoles, games, and controllers that are brought will be held in the console area and are monitored by an ACM or Gamer's Guild representative known as the Console Commander.  If an attendee brings a console item and does not log it with the Console Commander, it will be the sole responsibility of the attendee to watch it, and not ACM or Gamer’s Guild.</p>

                <h4>Door Prize Tickets &amp; Drawing</h4>
                
                <p>There will be two different door prize drawing events at the conclusion of the BYOC.</p>
                <p>Drawing One: All attendees are elligible for this drawing (students and non-students).  All people who are present at the drawing ceremony are eligible to win a door prize.  This drawing may contain more than one prize.</p>
                <p>Drawing Two: The second drawing will be for Penn College students only.</p>
                <p>This is a result of college policy that requires funding given to any student organization must be spent on Pennsylvania College of Technology students only.</p>
                <p>In the event that the winner of the general door prize is a Penn College student, they will be ineligible to win from the Penn College only drawing.</p>
                <p>Each attendee is eligible to win only ONE door prize, regardless of whether it is a general or Penn College-only drawing.</p>
                <p>When you come to the event and register, you will receive a door prize ticket. If you have your Penn College student ID with you at that time, you will also be given a second ticket for the Penn College-only drawing.</p>
                <p>The Winner of the Penn College drawing will need to give the ACM their student identification number for verification of enrollment.</p>
                <p>You may not, under any circumstances, redeem a prize for someone else with someone else’s ticket.  A person MUST be present in order to redeem a prize.  If an attendee is not present for the prize ceremony, they are NOT eligible for a prize.</p>
                <p>All people present at the event are eligible to win door prizes. This includes ALL event staff.  The drawing will be done randomly and in front of everyone, it will be completely fair.</p>
                <p>Anybody can enter and play in tournaments, including ALL event staff, even if the staff member is running the tournament.  We are honest people who are only interested in fun and fair play! There will be no dishonesty tolerated from anybody at the event, especially staff members.</p>

                <h4>Food and drinks</h4>
                
                <p>The ACM will be providing food and drink sales for the 12 hour duration of the event.  The food that is purchased during this time helps to pay for the event.  We appreciate your support by buying our food.</p>
                <p>You are allowed to go to local fast food restaurants and bring food in to the eating area.</p>
                <p>ABSOLUTELY NO food or drinks (including bottled beverages) are allowed on the game floor.  This mandate is passed down from Penn College as a stipulation for using their facilities. There will be no exceptions to this rule.</p>

                <h4>Games &amp; Tournaments</h4>
                
                <p>All game rules will be determined by the affiliated tournament leader. Any last minute changes that need to be made on the day of the event will be made by some sort of consensus between the players in that tournament.</p>
                <p>The tournament master has final say in all matters regarding individual tournaments.</p>
                <p>There's to be no use of third-party controllers of any kind during tournament play, however these controls are permitted in free play.</p>
                <p>Honest and fair match - If someone is playing in a tournament and are pushing the bounds of fair play i.e. screen hacking or camping, the tournament leader has ultimate discretion to determine penalties.</p>

                <h4>General conduct</h4>
                
                <p>The point of this event is for everyone to have fun in a safe and respectful environment.  Therefore, respect must be shown to all other attendees and staff at all times during this event.</p>
                <p>Anyone who shows a disregard for someone else will be asked to leave the event and their ability to win a door prize will be lost.</p>
